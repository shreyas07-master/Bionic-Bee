1. Ultra-light flying objects with delicate design :


At around 34 gms in weight, 22 cms in length & with a wingspan of 24 cms , the BionicBee is the smallest flying object from the Bionic Learning Network to date.

This is the 1st time, that the developers used the generative design method, after entering a few parameters, a software finds the optimal structure based on specific design principles in order to use as little material as necessary to create the most stable design possible. 

This consistent lightweight construction is crucial for good manoeuvrability & flight duration.



2. Functional integration in a tight installation space :


The bee‚Äôs body forms the compact housing for the beating wing mechanism, the communication technology as well as the control components for the wing beats and the adaptation of the wing geometry.

The intelligent interaction between the motors & mechanics means that the frequency of the wing beats can, for example, be precisely adjusted for the various manoeuvres.



Autonomous swarm behavior :


1. UWB‚Äëbased indoor positioning :
   
It is equipped with ultra-wideband anchors placed around the indoor environment to locate itself precisely in 3D space environment


3. Collision‚Äëfree swarm flight :

A central controller which is works like ( teach pendent for robotic arm ) assigns flight paths, & each bee self‚Äëlocalizes and follows these paths accurately to avoid collisions‚Äîeven accounting for turbulence.


5. Self‚Äëcalibrating algorithm :
   
Individual bees automatically adjust to slight manufacturing differences during a test flight, standardizing the swarm‚Äôs performance.
